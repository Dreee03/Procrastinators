## üîß Troubleshooting

### ‚ùå "AI Recommendations not showing"

**Check 1: API Key is set**
```bash
# Open .env file and verify:
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyD...  # Should be your actual key, not "your_gemini_api_key_here"
```

**Check 2: Restart the server**
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Start it again
python manage.py runserver
```

**Check 3: Learning style and goals are required**
- Go to `/register/` and create a new account
- Make sure you select a learning style from the dropdown
- Add learning goals (at least 10 characters)

**Check 4: Check the console for errors**
- Look for error messages in the terminal where Django is running
- Common error: `Invalid API key` ‚Üí Get a new key from Google AI Studio

### ‚ùå "API key not valid"

1. Generate a **new API key** at https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Delete the old one
3. Copy the new key to `.env` file
4. Restart Django server

### ‚ùå "Rate limit exceeded"

This means you've used all 60 requests in the last minute.

**Solution**: Wait 60 seconds, then try again.

**For development**: 
- Don't refresh the home page too quickly
- Each page load generates AI recommendations
- Consider caching recommendations (advanced)

---

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Cache Recommendations (Optional)
For production, consider caching AI recommendations to reduce API calls:
```python
# In views.py, check if user already has recommendations cached
# Only call AI service if cache is empty or expired
```

### Tip 2: Error Handling
The AI service has built-in fallbacks:
- If API fails, it returns basic recommendations
- Your app never breaks, even if API is down
- Users always get helpful content

### Tip 3: Monitor Usage
- Keep track of how many API calls you make
- 60/minute is generous for most apps
- A typical user visit = 1-2 API calls

### Tip 4: Customize Prompts
Edit `core/ai_service.py` to customize how the AI generates recommendations:
- Change the prompt structure
- Add more specific instructions
- Request different output formats
